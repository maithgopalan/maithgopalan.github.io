    This study examines the association between college students' sense of belonging and alcohol use during the COVID-19 pandemic using data from a 21-day daily diary study. Understanding patterns in college student belonging and alcohol use during COVID-19 is critical given that both variables can be impacted by social distancing measures. College students (N = 341) enrolled at a large, public northeastern university completed surveys daily for 21 days reporting on their daily sense of belonging and alcohol use. Students reported higher likelihood of alcohol use and drinking more drinks on days when they experienced higher sense of belonging. Additionally, average levels of sense of belonging across the study period were significantly associated with higher likelihood of any alcohol use and more drinks consumed on drinking days. Students' experiences during COVID-19 may be distinctly different from prior years, and this study sheds light on how feelings of belonging may have contributed to student alcohol use during this period.

    Research on racial disproportionality in school discipline remains a critical concern in education. This study examines racial disparities in school discipline across all US school districts from 2015 to 2020. Using data from the Office for Civil Rights at the US Department of Education, we document the patterns and trends in racial/ethnic disproportionality in school discipline across schools and districts nationally. We find persistent and widespread racial/ethnic disproportionality in discipline across districts, with Black students consistently experiencing higher rates of disciplinary actions compared to their peers. Our findings contribute to the understanding of systemic inequities in education and inform policy discussions around school discipline reform.

    Understanding what shapes students' sense of belonging in college is crucial for supporting student success. This study examines how personality traits relate to belonging among first-year college students (N = 974) at a large public university. Results from structural equation modeling revealed that more extraverted and more agreeable students reported higher belonging, while students higher in neuroticism reported lower belonging. The association between extraversion and belonging was partially mediated by social support, suggesting that extraverted students may experience greater belonging in part because they build stronger social networks. These findings highlight the role of individual differences in shaping students' college experiences and suggest potential ways to support belonging among students with different personality profiles.

    We examine whether state-mandated civics tests affect youth voter turnout in national elections. Using a difference-in-differences design comparing changes in youth voter turnout in states with and without civics test requirements, we find that these tests had no detectable effect on youth voter turnout. Event study estimates suggest parallel pre-trends and no effect after implementation. Our estimates are precise enough to rule out modest-sized effects in either direction. These findings are robust to alternative specifications and samples. The absence of effects holds across various political contexts and student subgroups. Survey evidence suggests that civics tests do not meaningfully affect political knowledge, engagement, or efficacy. Our results indicate that civics tests, as currently implemented, are ineffective at achieving their primary goal of increasing youth civic participation.

    Health and education outcomes are closely intertwined, yet health and education policies are often designed and implemented in isolation. This article reviews causal evidence on the relationship between health policies and educational outcomes, focusing on mechanisms through which health interventions affect academic achievement, attendance, and cognitive development. We examine evidence from various health policy domains including health insurance expansions, school-based health services, and public health initiatives. The review highlights both direct effects through improved student health and indirect pathways through family resources and school environments. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for designing integrated policies that effectively promote both health and educational outcomes.

    This study examines how school shootings affect school district spending and staffing decisions. Using event study and difference-in-differences designs with 16 years of district-level finance data, we find that school shootings have significant impacts on district expenditures and resource allocation. Districts increase spending on security and support services while reducing instructional expenditures. Staffing patterns shift toward more security personnel and mental health professionals. Effects persist for multiple years post-incident and vary with shooting severity. Results highlight how districts reallocate resources in response to school violence, with potential implications for educational equity and student outcomes.

    Can a brief social-belonging intervention improve college outcomes? We tested this question by delivering a social-belonging intervention through a naturalistic college transition program to 12,065 students at nine institutions in two preregistered experiments. The intervention represented diverse others' stories about belonging challenges in the transition to college and how these challenges can be overcome with time. Consistent with past small-scale studies, the intervention improved first-year grades and persistence for racial-ethnic minority, first-generation, and international students at more-selective institutions. Yet at less-selective institutions the intervention had no benefits, and it sometimes harmed persistence among students with poorer academic preparation from all groups. The results illustrate both the potential for psychological intervention to scale to benefit students and the critical importance of the institutional context for intervention success.

    This study investigates how parental access to public health insurance affects children's academic achievement. Using variation in states' income eligibility limits for parents under Medicaid and administrative data from public schools, we find that expanding parent eligibility significantly improves children's test scores. A 10 percentage point increase in the share of low-income parents eligible for Medicaid leads to a 0.09 standard deviation increase in children's math test scores. The effects are largest for elementary school students and English language learners. Improvements in family financial well-being and child health care access appear to be key mechanisms. Our findings demonstrate important spillover effects of adult health insurance expansions onto children's human capital development.

    This study examines the effects of recent state Medicaid expansions under the Affordable Care Act on family health-related financial well-being. Using data from the National Health Interview Survey and a difference-in-differences design, we find that Medicaid expansion significantly reduced families' medical debt and improved their ability to pay medical bills. The effects are particularly pronounced for low-income families and those with children. We also find evidence of improved mental health among parents. These findings suggest that expanding public health insurance access can have meaningful impacts on family financial stability and well-being, even when implemented years after the initial ACA expansion opportunity.

    This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of civil rights complaints in K-12 education across the United States. Using data from the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights, we examine patterns in complaint filings, types of alleged discrimination, and resolution outcomes from 2011-2018. We find significant disparities in complaint rates across states and districts, with higher rates in more diverse and economically disadvantaged areas. Disability discrimination comprises the largest share of complaints, followed by race and sex discrimination. Our analysis reveals substantial variation in resolution times and outcomes, raising questions about equity in civil rights enforcement. These findings have important implications for understanding and addressing civil rights violations in education.

    This study examines how expanding public health insurance eligibility for parents affects parent and child health outcomes. Using variation in income eligibility limits for parents under Medicaid across states and over time, we find that increased parental eligibility improves both parent and child health. Parents report better mental health and increased access to preventive care. Children experience improved health status and reduced school absences due to illness. These effects are particularly pronounced for families with lower incomes and those with previous unmet healthcare needs. Our findings suggest that parental access to healthcare has important spillover benefits for child health outcomes.

    Purpose: This study examined associations between college students' sense of belonging and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, and whether these associations differed for historically underrepresented students.

    Methods: Undergraduate students (N = 1,086) at a large, public university completed surveys reporting their sense of belonging and mental health. Sense of belonging was measured using established scales assessing institutional belonging and social acceptance. Mental health outcomes included depression, anxiety, and loneliness.

    Results: Lower sense of belonging was associated with poorer mental health outcomes across all measures. First-generation college students and racial/ethnic minority students reported lower belonging on average. The negative relationship between belonging and mental health was stronger for first-generation students. Individual and institutional factors moderated these relationships.

    Conclusions: Findings highlight the importance of belonging for student mental health during COVID-19, particularly for historically underrepresented students. Results suggest the need for targeted interventions to support belonging and mental health in higher education.

    Can psychological interventions improve academic persistence and achievement? We conducted a large-scale field experiment to address this question, delivering a social-belonging intervention to an entire cohort of first-year university students (N = 7,335). The intervention, delivered through a naturalistic institutional program, represented stories from diverse others about belonging challenges in the transition to college and how these challenges can resolve with time. Compared with a randomized control condition, the intervention improved first-year full-time enrollment, grade-point-average, and academic standing for historically underrepresented ethnic minority students. Effects persisted through senior year, culminating in a 3-percentage point increase in bachelor's degree completion rates among these students. The intervention was particularly effective at a selective campus with large racial achievement gaps. Results support the importance of scalable strategies to address belonging concerns to promote achievement and persistence among minority students.

    This article examines the growth, promise, and challenges of quasi-experimental research designs in educational research. We review the evolution of quasi-experimental methods, including regression discontinuity, difference-in-differences, and instrumental variables approaches. Drawing on examples from recent educational research, we discuss how these methods have advanced our understanding of educational policies and practices. We highlight both the strengths of these approaches in establishing causal relationships and their limitations. The article emphasizes the importance of careful research design, appropriate method selection, and transparent reporting of assumptions. We conclude by discussing future directions for quasi-experimental research in education and recommendations for researchers and policymakers.

    Students' sense of belonging in college is important for academic success and persistence, yet we know little about belonging across different institutional contexts. Using survey data from a large-scale field experiment at 21 colleges (N = 20,311), we examined student belonging overall and by race, gender, and first-generation status. Most students reported high belonging, yet inequality by race and first-generation status persisted across institutional contexts. Underrepresented racial minorities reported lower belonging at more selective, predominantly White institutions. First-generation students reported lower belonging than continuing-generation students, and this gap was larger at more selective institutions. While we found few gender differences overall, gender gaps varied by institutional context. Results highlight the importance of examining belonging at scale and understanding how belonging varies across students and institutions.

    This study investigates the relationship between racial/ethnic discipline gaps and achievement gaps in United States schools. Using multiple waves of data from the Civil Rights Data Collection, we examine how disciplinary practices correlate with academic outcomes across racial/ethnic groups. Our analyses reveal strong associations between higher rates of disciplinary actions against students of color and larger racial/ethnic achievement gaps. These relationships persist after controlling for school and district characteristics. We find evidence suggesting that disciplinary disparities may contribute to achievement gaps through reduced instructional time and negative school climate effects. The findings highlight the importance of addressing disciplinary practices as part of broader efforts to reduce educational inequities.

    A growth mindset is the belief that intelligence can be developed. Previous studies have shown that teaching students a growth mindset improves their academic achievement, but these studies were conducted in a limited number of schools and did not investigate where the intervention was most effective. Using a randomized experiment in a national sample of schools (N = 12,490 students), we tested whether a short online growth mindset intervention could improve grades among lower-achieving students. The intervention improved grades among lower-achieving students in schools with supportive peer norms. These findings suggest that the psychological environment of a school matters for the efficacy of psychological interventions and that these interventions could be a cost-effective way to reduce academic inequality at scale.

    This study examines racial disparities in school disciplinary practices using national data from the Civil Rights Data Collection. We find consistent patterns of disproportionate disciplinary actions against Black students compared to their White peers, even after controlling for behavioral infractions and school characteristics. These disparities are particularly pronounced in schools with higher proportions of White teachers and administrators. The analysis reveals that implicit bias, cultural mismatches, and institutional practices may contribute to these disparities. Our findings suggest the need for comprehensive reforms in school disciplinary policies and practices to address systemic racial inequities in education.

    This article reviews the application of behavioral insights in U.S. policy analysis over the past decade. We examine how behavioral science has influenced policy design and implementation across various domains including education, health, and social services. The review identifies key behavioral concepts that have been successfully applied in policy contexts and discusses methodological approaches for incorporating behavioral insights into policy analysis. We find growing evidence that behavioral interventions can improve policy outcomes, though their effectiveness varies by context and implementation. The article concludes with recommendations for future research and practice in behavioral policy analysis.
