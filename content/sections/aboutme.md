I am an Associate Professor at the [University of Oregon](https://education.uoregon.edu/), where I also hold the Petrone Professorship. 

At its core, educational equity is at the heart of all three strands of research that I am engaged in. Whether it is using demographic techniques to examine and highlight key educational disparities in students’ learning opportunities or using experimental and quasi-experimental research designs to inform policies and programs that aim to mitigate those educational disparities, I care deeply about students’ civil rights in schools. I also value my interdisciplinary social science training that spans economics, public policy, and social psychology to inform the design and evaluation of evidence-based education and social policies in the US. 

Together with Erica Frankenberg, I lead the [AdvancED Equity Initiative](https://advancedequity.org). Previously, I was a [Social Science Research Institute](https://ssri.psu.edu/) co-funded Faculty Fellow and an Associate Professor of Education and Public Policy at [The Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu/). Currently, I serve as an Associate Editor at the Educational Researcher.
