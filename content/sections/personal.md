**Website**: I am grateful to [Gautam Rao](https://gautam-rao.com/) who shared his personal website code and [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gautamrao/gautamrao.github.io) so generously. I just forked and made minor changes to the [acdemimal theme](https://github.com/yangl1996/academimal) there for building my website. Please feel welcome to use and re-purpose the code for your website, which you can now find at my [Github Repo](https://github.com/maithgopalan/maithgopalan.github.io) as well.
